# ProblemChild in the Elastic Stack 

ProblemChild helps detect anomalous activity in Windows process events by:
1) Classifying events as malicious vs benign
2) Identifying anomalous events based on rare parent-child process relationships

An end-to-end blog to create and leverage ProblemChild to detect anomalous Windows events can be found [here](link to blog).

You can also find some supplementary material for the blog and examples [here](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/ProblemChild)

We also released a blog on getting started with ProblemChild using the CLI and Kibana:
